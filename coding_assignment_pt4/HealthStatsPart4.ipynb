    "### Explanation of the Waist-to-Hips Ratio:\n",
    "  The <strong>waist-hip ratio</strong> or <strong>waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)</strong> is the dimensionless ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. \n",
    "  This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W ÷ H). \n",
    "  For example, a person with a 30″ (76 cm) waist and 38″ (97 cm) hips has a waist-hip ratio of about 0.78. \n",

    "### Relevance Waist-to-Hips Ratio:  \n",
    "WHR is an easy, inexpensive, and accurate way to see how much body fat you have. It can also help predict your risk for heart disease and diabetes.\n",
    "A few studies suggest that WHR is even more accurate than BMI for predicting the risks of cardiovascular disease and premature deathTrusted Source. For example, a 2015 study of more than \n",
    "15,000 adults showed that a high WHR was linked to an increased risk of early death — even in people with a normal BMI.\n",
    "This method could be particularly useful in certain groups of people. For example, WHR may be a better gauge of obesity in older adults whose body composition has changed. \n",
